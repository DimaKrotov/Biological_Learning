# Biological_Learning
Example of "biological" learning for MNIST based on the paper [Unsupervised Learning by Competing Hidden Units](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820458116) by D.Krotov and J.Hopfield. If you want to learn more about this work you can also check out this [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lY-oAY0aQU) from MIT's [6.S191 course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/).  

## Getting started

install jupyter notebook and numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
run `Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_MNIST.ipynb` and observe weights.
